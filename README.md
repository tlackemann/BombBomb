BombBomb
========

Run and defeat your fellow bombers before time runs out!

Written using
- ImpactJs* (http://impactjs.com)
- node.js (http://nodejs.org)
- socket.io (http://socket.io)
- HTML5

ImpactJs is sold commercially therefore I cannot provide it in the source code. To run the game as source, copy the 'impact' folder of ImpactJs into the 'lib' folder of BombBomb.

To run, type

    node app.js

You'll also be able to play it with other people (bandwidth permitted) on my personal site.
